# Netflux-Recommendation-Algorithm
This program was made for the Ryerson Engineering Programming Competition 2020. Given an eight hour deadline, we were given program to recreate. This competition was done in teams and I worked in a team of two. We were given two excel sheets with about 4000 entries each. Given user input, the program would search the data for movies that fall under that criteria. Each category has the same weight factor awarding a movie 1 points for each category it matches from the users preferences. This is all stored in an array. After giving a rank to each movie, the array is organized from lowest rank to highest rank using the selection sort algorithm and then the last five movies in the sorted array are outputted to the user. These is then stored in a file for users to look back to.
